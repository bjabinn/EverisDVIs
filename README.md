The idea of this project is to learn how to use new different technologies. Initially we’ll use just some of them but at the end I would like to us all these:

•	SOLID principles
![stack Overflow](https://github.com/bjabinn/EverisDVIs/blob/master/images/solidPrinciples.png)

 
•	Unit Test (Live Unit Testing)
   o	https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/test/developer-testing/getting-started/getting-started-with-developer-testing

•	Integration Test
•	Micro services architecture
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-overview-microservices
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microservices-an-application-revolution-powered-by-the-cloud/

Example:

 ![microServices](https://github.com/bjabinn/EverisDVIs/blob/master/images/microServices.png)


•	MVVM

•	.NET Core (initially ASP)

•	Entity Framework Core 

•	Typescript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html)

•	Angular (https://angular.io/

•	Docker (https://www.docker.com/)

•	Xamarin 

•	Visual Studio 2017 (to avoid crashes with VS 2015 Update X: see packages.js & csproj)

•	Git repository:
   o	https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/git/gitquickstart

During next day I’ll propose naming conventions, ie, something like this:

As you can still see there are some doubt about versions and they are because of checking compatibilities and integration approaches.

Using those technologies we are creating a core application (Web API), a web application and a mobile one later on.

The idea is to have a environment where we can register users, virtual machines, installed software inside these machines and register each log in and log out of the machines.


Initial diagram model could be:

Roadmap:
•	Create sql scripts

•	Create .NET Core Project in VS

•	Create project structure: Service, EF, Web, Model, Repository projects

•	Include & prepare EF in project

...

1 Controller by View

VIEWS to be implemented:
•	General Layout (top, container and footer)

•	Home View

•	Virtual Machines Management

•	Users Management (VirtualMachineId is a optional / favourite configuration for the user)

•	Management of Environment & Assignment between both Entities

•	Operations Management
