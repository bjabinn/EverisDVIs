The idea of this project is to learn how to use new different technologies. Initially we’ll use just some of them but at the end I would like to us all these:
•	SOLID principles
![stack Overflow](https://github.com/bjabinn/EverisDVIs/blob/master/images/solidPrinciples.png)

 
•	Unit Test (Live Unit Testing)
o	https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/test/developer-testing/getting-started/getting-started-with-developer-testing

•	Integration Test
•	Micro services architecture
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-overview-microservices
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microservices-an-application-revolution-powered-by-the-cloud/

Example:
 

•	MVVM
•	.NET Core (initially ASP)
•	Entity Framework Core 
•	Typescript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html)
•	Angular (https://angular.io/
•	Docker (https://www.docker.com/)
•	Xamarin 
•	Visual Studio 2017 (to avoid crashes with VS 2015 Update X: see packages.js & csproj)
•	Git repository:
https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/git/gitquickstart

During next day I’ll propose naming conventions, ie, something like this:

As you can still see there are some doubt about versions and they are because of checking compatibilities and integration approaches.

Initial diagram model could be:
